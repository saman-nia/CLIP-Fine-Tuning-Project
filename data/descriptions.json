A black neckerchief, tied \u00e0 la Ben Brace, a very high and not very clean shirt-collar, a rough flushing jacket garnished with broad black bone buttons, a very long waistcoat of a shawl pattern, and blue shaggy trousers splashed with mud at their terminations, complete the costume. The tout-ensemble forms an illustration of \u201cDecember fashions for Gentlemen,\u201d as modified in the person of a probationary guardian of the public health\u201d in statu pupillari,\u201d\u2014that is, in the course of \u201cwalking the hospitals.\u201d\n", "164.png": "A young man in shabby clothes and untidy hair is seen from the side sitting at a desk and biting into an apple while writing with a quill on a piece of paper.\nThe illustration is complemented by the following words from William Shakespeare\u2019s Merchant of Venice: His master and he are scarce cater-cousins.\n", "165.png": "A young woman wearing her hair looped back at the sides is seen looking to her right while her hand holding a needle pulls on the thread with which she is sewing a piece of lacy garment by candlelight.\nThe illustration is complemented by the following quotation from William Shakespeare\u2019s Henry IV, Part 1: Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks\u2026\n", "166.png": "View of the Cairo Citadel, a fortress complex initiated by Saladin in 1176 and seat of Egyptians rulers up to the 19th century. The authors describe it as follows:\nThis striking view is taken from a ruined mosque near the city walls, and looking towards the rock of the citadel, which stretches along the horizon, from where it intercepts the range of the distant Mocattam hills to the Great Mosque of the Sultan Hassan. Between the observer and the hill of the citadel lies the great necropolis of Cairo, that part of the eastern desert which extends from its walls to the Mocattam range, in which the dead of ages are laid, and where those splendid religious edifices are found which are commonly called the Tombs of the sultans. The ruined mosque in the foreground is built in an angle of the city wall. From one of the gates below a caravan is seen issuing, and masses of building which intervene between the ruined mosque and the Citadel are broken by the domes and minarets of the mosques of Cairo.\nThe citadel itself is covered with a range of buildings, that present in this view rather the appearance of a barracks than the palace and mosque of the Pasha, where he holds his court, though his domestic residence is in the isle of Shoubra. \n", "167.png": "View of the market street running between the two main buildings of the funerary complex of Sultan al-Ghuri, built in the early 16th century. The bazaar is described as follows by the authors:\nThe actual situation of this bazaar is between the walls of these two mosques, which finish at the top with a trefoil sort of battlement whereon rafters rest, with props to support the wooden roof, that at a great height covers the Bazaar, admitting light enough, but sheltering it from the rays of the sun. Each Bazaar is generally appropriated to a particular class of merchandise, and this, the chief in Cairo, for the sale of rich silks, cottons, and embroidered stuffs, some wrought in gold-thread and other costly materials; and the articles to be bought here are the most splendid productions of this class. The Bazaars of Cairo, as in all Eastern cities, are confined to streets and passages, which are closed at night by wooden doors and a chain, and guarded by watchmen: they are, however, by day the gayest and most amusing parts of the city. Here the shopkeeper rests on a sort of dais, or shopboard, about three feet above the footway, his goods being kept in recesses behind him. He generally sits cross-legged and patient, awaiting the arrival of a customer; he uses little art to induce him to purchase; he sits in solemn silence, and will scarcely remove his pipe from his lips to answer the inquiries of the passers-by.\n", "168.png": "View of Trajan\u2019s Kiosk overlooking the Nile at its original location on the island of Philae. The kiosk was moved to Agilkia Island in the 1960s to be preserved from the effects of the Aswan Dam. It is described as follows by the authors:\nThis is one of the most beautiful objects on the island of Philae, and seems to have been built for its striking and picturesque effect. It is placed on the eastern side of the island, and, in our view, appears as it is seen by the traveller who ascends the Nile. This little temple is only sixty feet long and forty-five feet wide: the style of its proportion is elongated, as if the architect had thus intended to increase its effect as seen from the river. It has five columns on each side, and four at each end, between the centre columns at each of these is an entrance; all else around is inclosed by walls, which reach to two-thirds of the height of the columns. The architrave is raised high above the columns, being placed on upright stones, which rest upon the lotus-headed capitals; the open spaces between are out of all architectural rule or proportion, but in spite of this, it is strikingly elegant. The entrances are open to the Great Temple on the west, and to the Nile on the east; outside the river-gate is a platform, or terrace, which forms also a quay that extends nearly round the island; the principal landing-place for travellers is below this temple, and here their boats are usually moored.\n", "169.png": "Perspective view of the Hypostyle Hall at the Karnak temple complex, with columns showing polychrome decoration.The hall was built under Pharaoh Seti I who reigned in the 13th century BCE. It is described as follows by George Henry Wathen[1]:\nMajestic in ruin, what must it have been when perfect? The massive stone roof is supported by a phalanx of one hundred and thirty-four giant columns, ranged in sixteen rows; most of these are nine feet in diameter, and nearly forty-three feet high; but those of the central avenue are not less than eleven feet six inches in diameter, and seventy-two feet high. The diameter of their capitals at their widest spread is twenty-two feet. The walls, columns, architraves, ceilings\u2014every surface exposed to the eye is overspread with intaglio sculptures\u2014gods, heroes, and hieroglyphics, painted in once vivid colours. It is easy to detail the dimensions of this building, but no description can convey an idea of its sublime effect. What massive grandeur in its vistas of enormous columns! what scenic effects in the gradations of the chiaro-scuro, and the gleamings of accidental lights athwart the aisles!\n\n\n^  Wathen, George Henry.

The temple and its rediscovery in 1817 are described as follows by the authors:\nBelzoni and his friends removed forty feet of sand, which had accumulated above the top of the door before the recent excavations; but they carried them no further than three feet below the top of the entrance, when they effected their passage into this temple and saw the most extraordinary work that remains to us of the age of Remeses [sic] II. Belzoni describes its facade as one hundred and seventeen feet wide and eighty-six feet high\u2026 Each of these enormous statues\u2026 measures from the shoulder to the elbow fifteen feet six inches\u2026 Their height as they sit is about fifty-one feet not including the caps, which are about fourteen feet. These, the most beautiful colossi yet found in any of the Egyptian ruins, represent Remeses II. They are seated on thrones attached to the rock. On the sides, and on the front angles of the thrones, and between the legs of the statues, are sculptured female figures, supposed to be of his wife and children; they are well preserved, though the material is a coarse friable gritstone. During the execution, defects in the stone were filled and smoothed with stucco, and afterwards painted, of which traces yet remain.\n", "171.png": "View of the temple of Kom Ombo as it stood, half-buried in the sand, before reconstruction. Built during the Ptolemaic dynasty, Kom Ombo Temple is located 25 miles (40 km) north of Aswan and was dedicated in equal parts to the crocodile god Sobek and to Horus the Elder. It is described as follows by the authors:\nThese ruins are finely situated on a promontory on the eastern side of the river, in a bay formed by the head of the Nile to the westward. In descending the river the temple thus seen on the high bank above it holds a striking position. There are remains of other temples below, on the verge of the Nile, but the stream which sweeps round the bend has already carried off, even within our own time, some of these interesting monuments, and will eventually remove them all by undermining the banks. Of the great temple, much is concealed by vast sand-drifts from the deserts; but enormous masses of its ruins rise above the arid and herbless surface which surrounds them, giving to the scene a character of dreary desolation in keeping with the decay of this once magnificent structure.\n", "172.png": "Plate showing ornamental capital letters X, Y, and Z illuminated with foliage, flowers, and birds.\nThe caption reads in the original Italian: L\u2019airone bianco \u2014 Il yacou \u2014 Lo ziollo.\n", "173.png": "Plate showing ornamental capital letters T, U, and V embellished with foliage, flowers, and pictures of birds.\nThe caption reads in the original Italian: Il tarangolo \u2014 L\u2019upupa \u2014 La vedova di fuoco.\n", "174.png": "Plate showing ornamental capital letters Q, R, and S embellished with foliage, flowers, and pictures of birds.\nThe caption reads in the original Italian: La quaglia della China \u2014 Il rubino topazio \u2014 Lo struzzo.\n", "175.png": "Plate showing ornamental capital letters N, O, and P embellished with foliage, flowers, and pictures of birds.\nThe caption reads in the original Italian: Il nibbio \u2014 L\u2019ottarda \u2014 Il pellicano.\n", "176.png": "Plate showing ornamental capital letters K, L, and M embellished with foliage, flowers, and pictures of birds.\nThe caption reads in the original Italian: Il kakatoes \u2014 Il lori rosso \u2014 Il manucode.\n", "177.png": "Plate showing ornamental capital letters G, H,and I embellished with foliage, flowers, and pictures of birds.\nThe caption reads in the original Italian: La garza grande \u2014 L\u2019hutu \u2014 L\u2019ibi bianco.\n", "178.png": "Plate showing ornamental capital letters D, E, and F illuminated with foliage, flowers, and birds.\nThe caption reads in the original Italian: Il dardaro verde \u2014 L\u2019eider \u2014 Il fiammante.\n", "179.png": "Plate showing ornamental capital letters A, B, and C embellished with foliage, flowers, and pictures of birds.\nThe caption reads in the original Italian: Il re degli avoltoj \u2014 Il bozzardo \u2014 La cicogna bianca.\n", "180.png": "A man riding a hydrocycle on a lake waves his cap at the coxswain and the crew of a rowing boat training at some distance.

These floats are joined together by a platform made of very light wood, on which the seat of the worker is raised, and underneath is the machinery for propelling the velocipede. The motive power is very simple, and corresponds to that employed to propel the bicycle on land, by the feet of the rider, the wheel being furnished with paddles in the water velocipede.
